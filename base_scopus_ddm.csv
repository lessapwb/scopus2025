105003306749,Data-driven power marketing strategy optimization and customer loyalty promotion,Chen B.,Energy Informatics,2025-12-01,10.1186/s42162-025-00510-y,0,State Grid Hebei Marketing Service Center,Article,"© The Author(s) 2025.In the context of intensifying competition within the power market, power companies face the dual challenges of enhancing customer loyalty and optimizing marketing strategies. This study addresses these challenges by employing the long-term and short-term memory (LSTM) network model to analyze data-driven power marketing strategies and their impact on customer loyalty. The LSTM model is trained on a dataset combining time-series power consumption data with customer interaction scores and market response rates. This enables the model to predict and explain customer responses to marketing efforts with greater accuracy. Unlike traditional marketing models, which lack the capacity to capture dynamic customer behavior over time, the LSTM model accounts for both the temporal nature of consumption patterns and static customer feedback, offering a more holistic view. Key findings indicate that improving the quality of customer service interaction and accurately targeting marketing activities significantly boosts customer loyalty. In particular, customer interaction scores and market response rates are the most influential factors driving customer loyalty, providing critical insights for companies to adjust their strategies effectively. This study’s novelty lies in its application of advanced machine learning methods, such as LSTM, to the power industry—a sector traditionally slower to adopt such innovations. By bridging this gap, the research provides actionable recommendations on how power companies can implement data-driven marketing strategies to improve service quality, increase customer retention, and enhance their competitive position in the market. Additionally, the results underscore the model’s effectiveness in forecasting and optimizing marketing outcomes, offering a scalable solution for the evolving power sector. In the power market, companies face challenges in enhancing customer loyalty and optimizing strategies. This study employs the LSTM network model, trained on combined time-series power consumption, customer interaction scores and market response rates data. Unlike traditional models that struggle with dynamic customer behavior capture, LSTM accounts for consumption pattern temporality and static feedback. It outperforms other techniques like Random Forest and XGBoost in handling time-dependent consumption data. The key findings highlight the importance of customer interaction and targeted marketing. By applying LSTM, power companies can better predict customer responses, optimize marketing, improve service quality and enhance competitive position, providing a scalable solution for the evolving power sector."

Specifically, we perform FDA on real-time tourist volume data from 56 major attractions in Beijing, China, revealing intrinsic fluctuation patterns, key factors driving tourist arrivals, and the dynamic characteristics of attractions across temporal scales. Our findings enhance the ability to optimize attraction management, marketing strategies, and policy-making, while also advancing tourism data science by integrating FDA. This approach fills the methodological gap and offers a comprehensive framework for exploring the spatiotemporal complexities of tourism data."
105004928963,Multi-Source Data-Driven Personalized Recommendation and Decision-Making for Automobile Products Based on Basic Uncertain Information Order Weighted Average Operator,Yang Y.,Sustainability Switzerland,2025-05-01,10.3390/su17094078,0,Hunan University of Technology and Business,Article,"© 2025 by the authors.The extensive electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) data generated by consumers encapsulates authentic product experience information. By leveraging advanced data analysis technologies, enterprises can extract sustainable consumer behavior preference knowledge, thereby supporting the optimization of their marketing and management strategies. However, existing data-driven product ranking processes predominantly focus on single-source eWOM data and rarely mine product insights from a multi-source perspective. Moreover, the quality of eWOM data cannot be overlooked. Consequently, this study uses automobile products as a case example and integrates rating eWOM data, complaint eWOM data, and safety test data to construct a multi-source data-driven personalized product ranking recommendation algorithm. Specifically, an evaluation index system is established for each of the three data types. To model information quality, these data are transformed into basic uncertain information (BUI), which incorporates scoring information and credibility metrics. The XLNet model is employed to convert complaint text data into scoring data, and three targeted credibility evaluation models are developed to assess the reliability of the three data types. Subsequently, BUI is aggregated using the BUI ordered weighted average (BUIOWA) aggregation operator. Based on this, a personalized product ranking method aligned with user preferences is proposed, offering consumers recommendation results that match their preferences. Finally, using automobile products as an illustrative example, this study elucidates the multi-source data-driven personalized product recommendation process and provides managerial implications for enterprises."
105003569894,Beyond the Battery: The Impact of Cultural Factor on Electric Vehicle Consumers’ Service Quality Expectations in Dealerships,Zhou Y.,World Electric Vehicle Journal,2025-04-01,10.3390/wevj16040229,0,Suzhou Vocational University,Article,"© 2025 by the authors.This research investigates the impact of cultural dimensions on service quality expectations in electric vehicle (EV) dealerships. Grounded in Hofstede’s cultural theory and employing a data-driven approach, the study utilizes a series of robust analytical techniques, including the SVM algorithm, factor analysis, and ANOVA. Through a comprehensive analysis of EV customers’ expectations for expertise, empathy, and responsiveness, the findings reveal that cultural dimensions significantly shape service quality expectations, regardless of the service provider’s gender. Notably, consumers with a stronger masculine orientation have lower expectations for expertise but higher expectations for empathy than those with a stronger feminine orientation. These findings challenge the traditional emphasis on gender as a key factor in service quality expectations and underscore the need to incorporate cultural values in service strategy design and quality improvement in the EV industry."
105005999555,Application of Formal Concept Analysis and Clustering Algorithms to Analyze Customer Segments,Budaya I.G.B.A.,Jurnal Resti,2025-04-01,10.29207/resti.v9i2.6184,0,Institute of Technology and Business STIKOM Bali,Article,"© 2025, Ikatan Ahli Informatika Indonesia. All rights reserved.Business development cannot be separated from relationships with customers. Understanding customer characteristics is important both for maintaining sales and even for targeting new customers with appropriate strategies. The complexity of customer data makes manual analysis of the customer segments difficult, so applying machine learning to segment the customer can be the solution. This research implements K-Means and GMM algorithms for performing clustering based on the Transaction data transformed to the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) data model, then implements Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) as an approach to analyzing the customer segment after the class labeling. Both K-Means and GMM algorithms recommended the optimal number of clusters as the customer segment is four. The FCA implementation in this study further analyzes customer segment characteristics by constructing a concept lattice that categorizes segments using combinations of High and Low values across the RFM attributes based on the median values, which are High Recency (HR), Low Recency (LR), High Frequency (HF), Low Frequency (LF), High Monetary (HM), and Low Monetary (LM). This characteristic can determine the customer category; for example, a customer that has HM and HR can be considered a loyal customer and can be the target for a specific marketing program. Overall, this study demonstrates that using the RFM data model, combined with clustering algorithms and FCA, is a potential approach for understanding MSME customer segment behavior. However, special consideration is necessary when determining the FCA concept lattice, as it forms the foundation of the core analytical insights."
105002401094,Multi-Stage Data-Driven Framework for Customer Journey Optimization and Operational Resilience,Wang T.C.,Mathematics,2025-04-01,10.3390/math13071145,0,"Soochow University, Taipei",Article,"© 2025 by the authors.Optimizing customer journeys is a critical challenge in e-commerce and financial services, attracting attention from marketing, operations research, and business analytics. Traditional customer analytics models, such as rule-based segmentation and regression models, rely heavily on structured transactional data, limiting their ability to capture latent behavioral patterns and adapt to multi-channel dynamics. These models often struggle to integrate unstructured data sources, failing to provide adaptive, personalized insights. To address these limitations, this study proposes a multi-stage data-driven framework integrating latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) for behavioral insights, deep learning for predictive modeling, and heuristic algorithms for adaptive decision-making. Empirical validation using Taiwanese financial institution data shows a 15% improvement in predictive accuracy compared to traditional machine-learning models, significantly enhancing customer lifetime value (CLV) predictions and multi-channel resource allocation. This research highlights the practical value of integrating structured and unstructured data for improving customer analytics. Our framework leverages LDA to extract behavioral patterns from customer interactions, enriching predictive models and enhancing real-time decision-making in financial services. Robustness checks confirm the scalability and adaptability of this approach, offering a data-driven strategy for long-term value optimization in dynamic digital ecosystems."
105002061768,How data-driven personalisation allows marketers to meet customers’ ever-increasing expectations for relevance,Hou Z.,Applied Marketing Analytics,2025-03-01,10.69554/BOYM1097,0,Media Volery,Article,"© Henry Stewart Publications.Consumer expectations for relevance are higher than ever. Research conducted by the author found that consumers want brands to offer personalisation, with 85 per cent of US adults saying that it is ‘somewhat’ to ‘extremely’ important for brands to share personalised recommendations with them. While marketers agree that it is important for brands to offer personalised marketing messages and offers to consumers, less than half of marketers say their organisations collect enough data. This paper explores three of the key roadblocks to building a robust data-driven marketing organisation and the methods by which organisations can address those challenges. The paper concludes with a look at the opportunities to build competitive advantage through more personalised and relevant marketing messages, in an environment where the majority of organisations have not yet acted upon these customer expectations."
105000924602,Optimal Decision-Making in a Green Supply Chain Duopoly: A Comparative Analysis of Subsidy Strategies with Data-Driven Marketing,Yao Y.,Mathematics,2025-03-01,10.3390/math13060965,0,School of Business,Article,"© 2025 by the authors.In the current context of severe environmental challenges and climate change, the low-carbon green development model has become an international consensus. This study establishes a green supply chain duopoly competition model, considering two types of government subsidies and data-driven marketing (DDM) to help achieve supply chain development. The aim of the research is to explore how to provide green subsidies, enhance green levels, maintain competitive advantage, and improve profits in supply chain enterprises with inconsistent green levels. The study discusses the impact of green consumer preferences, market competition, and DDM quality on the profits of supply chain enterprises. It also analyzes how to use supply chain contracts to achieve coordination and optimization within the supply chain. The findings are summarized as follows. (1) As consumer preferences for green products increase, the unit subsidy model continues to enhance performance and market share more effectively than the total subsidy model. (2) The unit subsidy model requires a more relaxed subsidy coefficient, making it easier for enterprises to develop without needing high subsidies. It consistently achieves better total performance, particularly with improved DDM quality. (3) Manufacturers and retailers can achieve a win–win situation through internal coordination of the supply chain via wholesale price contracts. (4) Under certain conditions, consumers more sensitive to green products will increase the product pricing of both M1 and M2. The level of greenness of M2 will also increase. But also, the wholesale and retail prices of M1 will decrease because of the effect of DDM. (5) The effect of the intensity of market competition on pricing decisions is more complex. Under certain conditions, the market competition coefficient has a positive impact on the pricing of M1 and a negative impact on the pricing and green level of M2. This can be changed due to an increase in the level of DDM quality, where an increase in the market competition coefficient results in lower pricing for M1 and higher pricing for M2. The green level for M2 is also improved. In addition, the improvement in DDM quality consistently has a positive impact on pricing decisions and green levels for M2. Pricing decisions for M1 are affected differently, depending on the customer’s sensitivity to DDM."

To a large degree, prior research has attributed such differences to the human factor. Nevertheless, there is still limited knowledge concerning what impact competencies of key personnel have on generating value from BA initiatives, and to what extent such outcomes complement a firm’s investment in BA. To examine these questions, this study explores the complementary relationship between BA capabilities and π-shaped skills. It posits that the concurrent presence of both indirectly influences innovation outcomes by fostering a data-driven culture. We build on a sample of 185 individuals with supervisory positions in Turkey to unpack this process. The findings revealed that BA capabilities and π-shaped skills influence a firm’s data-driven culture, which in turn impacts the firms’ marketing innovation, and subsequently its innovative performance.

Usually, such studies are retrospective in nature rather than controlled experiments; hence, pre-existing bias in the observed data can distort the true effect of treatment. Previous studies on uplift modeling has largely overlooked this bias, focusing instead on model-based solutions for specific applications. In this paper, we introduce a new data-driven framework for uplift modeling based on matching. We represent individuals in treatment and control groups using weighted bipartite graphs, and bipartite graph matching is then employed to retain similar individuals, thereby reducing bias. Subsequently, appropriate datasets are generated from the matched pairs for learning predictive models for individuals. Our proposed model-independent framework facilitates robust inferences, making it adaptable to a wide range of applications and settings. In particular, we demonstrate how uplift modeling can be applied to discrimination discovery and prevention in discrimination-aware data mining. We evaluate our framework on three datasets representing three different applications. The results reveal that our framework produces better prediction performances in comparison to others and is easy to apply in practice."

All rights reserved.The combination of highly focused audience populations and much more precise industry, account and buyer persona-based segments make using deterministic approaches to plan, target, deploy and optimise media and marketing programmes in a business-to-business (B2B) environment a major challenge. Recent media benchmarking data confirms that hyper-pareto economics of audience targeting in B2B marketing can dramatically improve the yield and business impact of investments in paid, owned, earned and shared media programmes. This paper builds on existing academic research into audience targeting by adding qualitative interviews with 100 B2B marketing leaders and specific case examples from Terminus to examine how leading marketers are using probabilistic analytical approaches to shrink the audience bullseye and improve the business impact of media. The paper explores how B2B marketers are taking advantage of advances in analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to combine company, customer, channel and context data from a variety of internal and external sources to model highly targeted and accurate audiences and segments. It provides a blueprint for how the best marketers are using internal company, opportunity and sales coverage data from customer relationship management (CRM) and first party customer engagement data from paid, owned, earned and shared digital marketing channels as the foundation for targeting audiences and identifying signals of interest, consideration, response and intent. It shows how marketers can further supplement this targeting data foundation with third party contextual data around account structures, audience graphs and buyer intent to continuously improve targeting accuracy with closed loop analysis of customer response data. Shrinking the audience bullseye in this manner allows marketers to improve the financial impact of marketing investments by a third or more, by targeting marketing programmes and resources to prospects in specific accounts, job roles and sales territories while zeroing in on the fraction of prospects who are actively in the market to buy at any time."
85205013894,An interpretable data-driven approach for customer purchase prediction using cost-sensitive learning,Xiao F.,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2024-12-01,10.1016/j.engappai.2024.109344,1,Central South University,Article,"© 2024 Elsevier LtdCustomer purchase prediction can not only identify potential consumers but also help companies carry out related marketing activities based on the prediction results. In the field of marketing, ‘Buy till you die’ (BTYD) models are perhaps the most representative techniques for customer purchase prediction. Unlike BTYD models that rely more on probability distributions and a small number of input variables, machine learning models are a data-driven approach to extract information from a large number of input variables. To explore whether these two different classes of models can cross-fertilize each other, this paper incorporates Beta Geometric/Negative Binomial Distribution (BG/NBD) model into extreme gradient boosting (XGB) model to obtain the customer purchase predictions. To optimize profit-oriented decision-making, this study develops a profit-oriented XGB (POXGB) approach. This approach involves training a prediction model with the objective of directly maximizing the profit of downstream decision-making tasks. We conduct an empirical assessment of the prediction performance of BTYD modeling and machine learning with a real-world travel service purchase dataset. The integrative model shows a significant improvement over POXGB. This research contributes to the purchase forecasting literature and practical implications."

One of the main challenges is related to only partial availability of the performance metrics: although some users can be unambiguously classified as bots, the correct label is uncertain in many cases. This calls for the use of classifiers capable of explaining their decisions. This paper demonstrates two such mechanisms based on features carefully engineered from web logs. The first is a man-made rule-based system. The second is a hierarchical model that first performs clustering and next classification using human-centred, interpretable methods. The stability of the proposed methods is analyzed and a minimal set of features that convey the class-discriminating information is selected. The proposed data processing and analysis methodology are successfully applied to real-world data sets from online publishers."

All rights reserved.The uncertainty in impression supply presents a significant challenge to the optimal allocation of advertising resources. To address this uncertainty, this paper proposes a data-driven distributionally robust model for targeted display ad allocation problem. Firstly, a stochastic programming model with chance constraints is formulated, with the objective of maximizing the publisher’s revenue and penalizing both the unmet demand and the excess of demand. Second, using historical impression supply data, a data-driven distributionally robust chance-constrained model is established. This model utilizes the Wasserstein ambiguity set to propose an allocation strategy that maximizes the publisher’s revenue even under the worst-case distribution of impression supply. Through a conservative approximation, the model can be reformulated as an easy-to-solve mixed-integer programming problem. Finally, large-scale out-of-sample experiments are conducted to validate the feasibility, efficiently, and stability of the model and the solving approach."

Previous research has predominantly focused on inside-out organizational factors as drivers of customer analytics capability. This paper examines the role of outside-in resource, the complementarity between outside-in and inside-out resources, and their boundary conditions. Specifically, we study how customer orientation culture (an outside-in resource) complements data-driven culture (an inside-out resource) in firms of different ages to drive customer analytics capability and subsequently, firm performance. Using survey data obtained from Canadian firms, we find that customer orientation is not only positively related to customer analytics capability but also reinforces the effect of data-driven culture. We further find that the conditional effect of customer orientation becomes stronger as firm age increases. In particular, among older firms, the impact of data-driven culture is greatest when customer orientation is high, but it becomes nonsignificant when customer orientation is low. We also link these relationships to firm performance using mediation and moderated mediation analyses. Overall, the results suggest that achieving customer analytics excellence and resultant competitive performance requires marketing to continuously act as customer champions and advocate data analytics efforts to ensure the firm embraces an outside-in orientation."

Given the essential role played by B2B marketing departments in new product and service development, this paper takes an abductive approach to elucidate how the data-driven innovation capability of marketing can be constructed by identifying its constituent elements and underlying processes. It draws upon the existing literature on digital marketing capabilities applied to innovation and 17 in-depth interviews with B2B managers. The paper proposes a capability model for the data-driven innovation capability of marketing that articulates building blocks according to three major phases: (1) ideation, (2) analysis, and (3) deployment. It reveals the resources and competencies for operationalizing three successive routines to: (1) generate a knowledge ecosystem, (2) disseminate data-driven insights, and (3) design an answer. Each routine is facilitated by three distinct learning mechanisms that (1) capture, (2) articulate, and (3) codify, throughout the innovation phases. Furthermore, potential enablers and consequences are identified to offer an overall process-oriented framework. This study provides valuable guidance to marketing managers by determining the critical resources, routines, and learning mechanisms for engaging in data-driven innovation."

This paper conceptualizes growth hacking, a managerial-born process to embed a data-driven mind-set in marketing decision-making that combines big-data analysis and continuous learning, allowing companies to adapt their dynamic capabilities to the ever-shifting international competitive arenas. Design/methodology/approach: Given the scarcity of studies on growth hacking, this paper conceptualizes this managerial-born concept through the double theoretical lenses of IDMCs and information technology (IT) literature. Findings: The authors put forward research propositions concerning the four phases of growth hacking and the related capabilities and routines developed by companies to deal with international markets. Additional novel propositions are also developed based on the three critical dimensions of growth hacking: big data analytics, digital marketing and coding and automation. Research limitations/implications: Lack of prior conceptualization as well as the scant literature makes this study liable to some limitations. However, the propositions developed should encourage researchers to develop both empirical and theoretical studies on this managerial-born concept. Practical implications: This study develops a detailed compendium for managers who want to implement growth hacking within their companies but have failed to identify the necessary capabilities and resources. Originality/value: The study presents a theoretical approach and develops a set of propositions on a novel phenomenon, observed mainly in managerial practice. Hence, this study could stimulate researchers to deepen the phenomenon and empirically validate the propositions."

Testing can now be set and delivered within seconds, making optimisations faster than ever. However, traditional models, such as A/B testing and multi-variate testing, face challenges as marketing professionals seek to expand experimentation to areas where controlled conditions cannot be met. Among these is the case of search engine optimisation (SEO) experimentation, an area that is steadily becoming a crucial element in modern marketing strategies. This paper explores the use of quasi-experimental designs to overcome these challenges, allowing for the collection of insights when traditional experimental setups are unfeasible. Examples are provided to show how quasi-experiments can be effectively applied in multiple SEO scenarios, assessing the performance of the treated pages and using correlation to generate comparable control groups. It advocates for a shift in the mindset of digital marketing professionals, stressing the importance of adaptability in experimental approaches, underscoring the necessity to embrace quasi-experimental designs in modern marketing strategies by highlighting their pivotal role in achieving data-driven insights in an increasingly complex digital world."

Significant tensions tend to arise across this gap. However, the data-driven experimentation, and the organizational capabilities developed within the firm, increase the ability of the company to foster technological forecasting and business model innovation. It is argued within this paper, that growth hacking actually mitigates these tensions. This paper is a critical review complemented with insights from practitioners and an illustrative case, the purpose of which is to: a) shed light on what growth hacking is; b) give practical tips on how to implement growth hacking. In achieving the first goal, the paper unravels the following myths. First, growth hacking is not a framework for platforms and high-tech companies only. Second, it is not only a marketing strategy and third, that growth hacking is a predefined process. These issues are traced back to two flawed assumptions underlying growth hacking; namely that (a) it is a framework designed for start-ups only and (b) that a “one size fits all” approach to growth hacking is appropriate. By unravelling those issues and combining these observations we shall provide ground for a fundamentally different approach to growth hacking, designed for business model scalability, enabled for adaptability in a changing business environment and focused throughout on the effective management of a firm's resources and capabilities. These insights shall guide scholars towards a better understanding of the phenomenon and of the two waves that characterize its evolution, providing also promising future research avenues. Moreover, the implications drawn from the discussion shall help managers in guiding their journey from strategy definition to strategy implementation."

Previous research has paid attention to exploring the influence of marketing analytics on business performance, and rarely examined how the use of marketing analytics influences customer agility and satisfaction. According to the dynamic capabilities view and using previous studies, we developed a conceptual framework to explore the effect of marketing analytics use on customer agility and customer satisfaction. In Study 1, we utilised cross-sectional data collected from 468 managers from various industries. In study 2, we employed longitudinal data in a three-wave longitudinal utilising a cross-lagged panel model. Study 1 indicated that data acquisition and tool acquisition are key drivers in adopting marketing analytics. Marketing analytics use has stronger effect on customer agility when market turbulence is high. They also revealed that the influence of customer agility on customer satisfaction in such conditions is stronger. Study 2 revealed that marketing analytics use at time point T1 has a significant and positive influence on customer agility at time point T2, while customer agility at time point T2 has a significant and positive influence on customer satisfaction at time point T3. These findings indicate strong temporal effects between marketing analytics use, customer agility, and customer satisfaction. The findings suggest that researchers should look beyond direct effects of marketing analytics use and shift their attention on how a marketing analytics can be leveraged to enable and support dynamic capabilities and customer satisfaction."

The major concern of managers, especially when facing severe environmental issues, is to adjust proper measures regarding DDM promotions (including consumers’ DDM preference and offline free riding), so as to ensure efficient implementation of the cap and trade regulation (CTR). We developed two models: No-CTR and CTR under centralized and decentralized scenarios, and then proposed corresponding contracts to achieve Pareto improvement. The validity of both coordination schemes has been demonstrated. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the results indicate that encouraging DDM promotions and consumers’ environmental awareness are not always beneficial to the manufacturer or retailers. Certain conditions should be met based on promotions and wholesale price. Secondly, comparing No-CTR with CTR, promotions should be set for different carbon quotas to ensure all members prefer CTR. Especially, when carbon quota is moderate, below a certain level can also be optimal. Furthermore, numerical analysis suggests that with the increase of carbon trading price, the online quantity will evolve from downward to upward, as will both retailers’ profit. Entrepreneurs should be mindful of balancing the trade-offs contingent on DDM promotion effect because it plays an essential role in CTR implementation efficiency. In our model, stochastic demand is also considered."

By integrating structural equation modeling, particularly through SmartPLS4, we thoroughly examine the interrelations of perceived quality, competence, likeability, and trust, and how they culminate in customer satisfaction and loyalty. Our comprehensive dataset is drawn from a varied demographic of banking consumers, ensuring a holistic view of the sector’s reputation dynamics. The research reveals the profound influence of these constructs on customer decision-making, with likeability emerging as a critical driver of satisfaction and allegiance to the bank. We also rigorously test our model’s internal consistency and convergent validity, establishing its reliability and robustness. While the direct involvement of Business Intelligence (BI) tools in the research design may not be overtly articulated, the analytical techniques and data-driven approach at the core of our methodology are synonymous with BI’s capabilities. The insights garnered from our analysis have direct implications for data-driven decision-making in banking. They inform strategies that could include enhancing service personalization, refining reputation management, and improving customer retention efforts. We acknowledge the need to more explicitly detail the role of BI within the research process. BI’s latent presence is inherent in the analytical processes employed to interpret complex data and generate actionable insights, which are crucial for crafting targeted marketing strategies. In summary, our research not only contributes to academic discourse on marketing and customer perception but also implicitly demonstrates the value that BI methodologies bring to understanding and influencing consumer behavior in the banking sector. It is this blend of analytics and marketing intelligence that equips banks with the strategic leverage necessary to thrive in today’s competitive financial landscape."

The traditional marketing model finds it challenging to adapt to the evolving needs, making precision marketing for cross-border e-commerce platforms particularly crucial. This paper, based on the big data-driven path of operating cross-border e-commerce platforms, designs the operation strategy of these platforms from the perspective of precision marketing and empirically analyzes its impact. The RFM model is first used to design user value labels, and the K-means algorithm then uses the clustered labels. Combined with mining the three types of key data—user basic attributes, user value labels, and user consumption behaviors—of Company A’s Amazon store to construct user profiles, analyze them, and further design precise marketing strategies based on user profiles and analyze their effects, This paper classifies customer groups into three categories: high-value premium types, dynamic premium types, and growth types. High-value, quality customers account for most of Company A’s business, and through personalized marketing, their sales show a certain growth trend. Vitality-quality customers stimulate the desire to buy by recommending new products and activating old ones, and their sales increased to $32,527 in the fourth quarter. The impact of growth-type customers using consumption coupons and discount codes to stimulate consumption and purchases is flat, with no significant growth. This indicates that the operation strategy in this paper is more obvious and can be used as a precursor for further optimization."

85192345515,DPMS: Data-Driven Promotional Management System of Universities Using Deep Learning on Social Media,Hossain M.E.,Applied Sciences Switzerland,2023-11-01,10.3390/app132212300,13,Daffodil International University,Article,"© 2023 by the authors.SocialMedia Marketing (SMM) has become a mainstream promotional scheme. Almost every business promotes itself through social media, and an educational institution is no different. The users’ responses to social media posts are crucial to a successful promotional campaign. An adverse reaction leaves a long-term negative impact on the audience, and the conversion rate falls. This is why selecting the content to share on social media is one of the most effective decisions behind the success of a campaign. This paper proposes a Data-Driven Promotional Management System (DPMS) for universities to guide the selection of appropriate content to promote on social media, which is more likely to obtain positive user reactions. The main objective of DPMS is to make effective decisions for Social Media Marketing (SMM). The novel DPMS uses a well-engineered and optimized BiLSTM network, classifying users’ sentiments about different university divisions, with a stunning accuracy of 98.66%. The average precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score of the DPMS are 98.12%, 98.24%, 99.39%, and 98.18%, respectively. This innovative Promotional Management System (PMS) increases the positive impression by 68.75%, reduces the adverse reaction by 31.25%, and increases the conversion rate by 18%. In a nutshell, the proposed DPMS is the first promotional management system for universities. It demonstrates significant potential for improving the brand value of universities and for increasing the intake rate."

It can also assist businesses in making data-driven decisions about product development, marketing strategies, and customer service. However, as social media information continues to grow exponentially, and industry demands increase, sentiment analysis should no longer be limited to fundamental polarity classification of positive, neutral, and negative. Instead, it should move to more precise classification of emotions. Therefore, in this paper, we expand sentiment analysis to analysis of eight different emotions based on Plutchik's wheel of emotions, and define it as a multi-label classification task to identify complex and mixed emotions in text. We achieved an overall precision of 0.7958 for the eight emotions multi-label classification based on the attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory with convolution layer (AC-BiLSTM) model on the SemEval-2018 dataset. In addition, we proposed the introduction of the NRC emotion lexicon and emotion correlation constraints to optimise the emotion classification results. This ultimately increased the overall precision to 0.8228 demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we store and visualise the emotion analysis results in a graph structure, in order to achieve deductibility and traceability of emotions."

This study develops a data-driven DSC, including an online manufacturer and an offline retailer with stochastic demand. Then it discusses the effects of the selling price, wholesale price, stock-out-based substitution rate, Data-Driven Marketing (DDM), and two channels’ sensitivity of product quality on the optimal decisions (quality improvement effort, online inventory level, and offline order quantity), and the optimal expected profits. It also analyzes the coordination of the manufacturer's buyback contract. This work is mainly concluded as follows: (1) Increases in DDM quality can increase inventory levels in both channels and efforts to enhance quality, but they can also lower customer return rates, which makes sense. However, it is not always true that DDM quality positively affects the total supply chain expected profit. (2) The decline of one channel's stock-out-based substitution rate can raise its inventory level but decrease the inventory level of the competitive channel. Contrarily, the selling price of one channel is adversely connected with the inventory level of the competitive channel, which extends some existing studies under a decentralized decision. (3) The increase of sensitivity of product quality can lead to the growth of quality improvement efforts (consistent with previous literature) and the reduction of consumer return rate. (4) The manufacturer's buyback contract can well coordinate both members under stochastic demand for Pareto-optimality. Finally, this study proposes some managerial implications and further research directions."

The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it shows that time spent on social media is also, and primarily, the result of deliberate retention strategies implemented by platforms. Second, it identifies behavioral tools (Kahneman and Tversky in Econometrica 47, 1979) and develops a model that analyzes how these tools are combined to retain users: they encourage behavioral inertia and increase user enjoyment without requiring much effort. Ultimately, beyond the interest in identifying and characterizing these behavioral retention strategies, understanding how they work is a first step toward regaining control over our choices and behaviors. The article also aims to guide lawmakers in their efforts to protect consumers."
85164829959,Cold Start to Improve Market Thickness on Online Advertising Platforms: Data-Driven Algorithms and Field Experiments,Ye Z.,Management Science,2023-07-01,10.1287/mnsc.2022.4550,9,The Grainger College of Engineering,Article,"© 2022 INFORMS.Cold start describes a commonly recognized challenge for online advertising platforms: with limited data, the machine learning system cannot accurately estimate the click-through rates (CTR) of new ads and, in turn, cannot efficiently price these new ads or match them with platform users. Traditional cold start algorithms often focus on improving the learning rates of CTR for new ads to improve short-term revenue, but unsuccessful cold start can prompt advertisers to leave the platform, decreasing the thickness of the ad marketplace. To address these issues, we build a data-driven optimization model that captures the essential trade-off between short-term revenue and long-term market thickness on the platform. Based on duality theory and bandit algorithms, we develop the shadow bidding with learning (SBL) algorithms with a provable regret upper bound of O(T2=3K1=3 (logT)1=3d1=2), where K is the number of ads and d captures the error magnitude of the underlying machine learning oracle for predicting CTR. Our proposed algorithms can be implemented in a real online advertising system with minimal adjustments. To demonstrate this practicality, we have collaborated with a large-scale video-sharing platform, conducting a novel, two-sided randomized field experiment to examine the effectiveness of our SBL algorithm. Our results show that the algorithm increased the cold start success rate by 61.62% while compromising short-term revenue by only 0.717%. Our algorithm has also boosted the platform’s overall market thickness by 3.13% and its long-term advertising revenue by (at least) 5.35%. Our study bridges the gap between the theory of bandit algorithms and the practice of cold start in online advertising, highlighting the value of well-designed cold start algorithms for online advertising platforms."

All rights reserved.Purpose – This research aims to obtain an in-depth understanding of medical tourists’ segments and the variations that exist within them as tourists and patients. Design/Methodology/Approach – A data-driven segmentation approach using the two-step cluster analysis technique was applied on a sample of 212 participants visiting Lebanon for medical purposes. The research instruments combine travel motivation variables, along with socio-demographic, geographic, and behavioral characteristics. Findings and implications – The results identified two distinct segments: “the international patients” and “the elective medical tourists.” The delineated segments have significant implications for scholars, allowing them to understand the profile of tourists and their associated motivations and behaviors better. They can guide medical tourism service providers, marketers, and destination managers in providing specific medical tourism products and services that meet the expectations of each segment. Limitations – Limitations were experienced during the data collection process due to a lack of collaboration and prompt responses by some medical centers, as well as the political and economic contexts of Lebanon that discouraged tourism inflow. These limitations prevented the researchers from obtaining a larger sample size. Originality – There is limited understanding of medical tourists and their diversities in medical tourism literature to date. This study addresses the gap by proposing a new segmentation method in the field of medical tourism that delineates segments by investigating medical tourists’ travel motivations in line with their characteristics."

This in-market study focuses on gender differences to investigate different types of visual attention for place-based advertising in a digital marketing context. This study adopts a data-driven scientific approach and demonstrates that gender differences can assess shoppers’ viewing behavior and preference towards different promotional content based on gender schemas. Our results find that gender dynamics are complex. On the one hand, our findings show that female shoppers are more likely to respond to gaze cues and notice place-based advertising if others are also looking at the ad. On the other hand, male shoppers display longer staying and fixation times than females. Although a few detailed results are mixed, in our additional investigation, we found that gender is still a key factor in explaining the initial visual attention to promotional content within place-based advertising."

Design/methodology/approach: This work establishes a DSC model with DDM, and the offline retailer can provide internal financing to the capital-constrained online manufacturer. The demand under the price is determined based on DDM quality, customer channel preference and delivery lead time. Then, combined with the Stackelberg game, the optimal pricing and delivery-lead-time decisions are discussed under the inconsistent and consistent pricing strategies with decentralized and centralized systems. Furthermore, it designs a manufacturer-revenue sharing contract to coordinate the members under the two pricing strategies. Findings: (1) The increase of DDM quality will reduce the delivery-lead-time under the inconsistent or consistent pricing strategy and will push the selling prices; (2) The growth of the CCR rate will raise selling prices and extend the delivery-lead-time under the decentralized decision; (3) Under price competition, the offline selling price is higher than the online selling price when customers prefer the offline channel and vice versa; (4) The retailer and the manufacturer can achieve a win-win situation through a manufacturer-revenue sharing contract. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the studies related to DSC by investigating pricing and delivery-lead-time decisions based on DDM, CCR, internal financing and supply chain contract and proposes some managerial implications."

In addition, the Internet platform is becoming a new channel to realize green traceability and promote the sale of agricultural products. In this context, we consider a two-level green agricultural products supply chain (GAPSC) consisting of one supplier and one Internet platform. The supplier makes green R&D investments to produce green agricultural products along with conventional agricultural products, and the platform implements green traceability and data-driven marketing. The differential game models are established under four government subsidy scenarios: no subsidy (NS), consumer subsidy (CS), supplier subsidy (SS), and supplier subsidy with green traceability cost-sharing (TSS). Then, the optimal feedback strategies under each subsidy scenario are derived using Bellman’s continuous dynamic programming theory. The comparative static analyses of key parameters are given, and the comparisons among different subsidy scenarios are conducted. Numerical examples are employed to obtain more management insights. The results show that the CS strategy is effective only if the competition intensity between two types of products is below a certain threshold. Compared to the NS scenario, the SS strategy can always improve the supplier’s green R&D level, the greenness level, market demand for green agricultural products, and the system’s utility. The TSS strategy can build on the SS strategy to further enhance the green traceability level of the platform and the greenness level and demand for green agricultural products due to the advantage of the cost-sharing mechanism. Accordingly, a win-win situation for both parties can be realized under the TSS strategy. However, the positive effect of the cost-sharing mechanism will be weakened as the supplier subsidy increases. Moreover, compared to three other scenarios, the increase in the environmental concern of the platform has a more significant negative impact on the TSS strategy."

Meaning, nobody looks beyond the first page of search results. In a cookie-free future, search engines double down on how marketers communicate expertise, authority, and trust. This pushes brands to shift away from product-focused search engine marketing, toward an intent-based approach. To stay at the top of search engine results, marketers must understand consumer assessment of search results. Guided by an integrated framework combining UTAUT2, theory of reasoned action, and media richness theory, this empirical study used a 2 (search result type: organic vs. sponsored) × 3 (presentation format: text-only vs. image vs. video) between-subjects research design for assessing the effects of search results on consumer decisions.

One area where social media advertising is just gaining a foothold is in the recruitment of clinical study participants. Here, as everywhere, social media advertising promises more yield per money spent because the technology can better reach highly specialised groups. In this article, we point out severe societal risks posed by advertising for clinical studies on social media. We show that social media advertising for clinical studies in many cases violates the privacy of individual users (R1), creates collective privacy risks by helping platform companies train predictive models of medical information that can be applied to all their users (R2), exploits the weaknesses of existing guidelines in (biomedical) research ethics (R3) and is detrimental to the quality of (biomedical) research (R4). We argue that the well-intentioned promises, which are often associated with the use of social media advertising for clinical studies, are untenable from a balanced point of view. Consequently, we call for updates of research ethics guidelines and better regulation of Big Data and inferential analytics. We conclude that social media advertising – especially with vulnerable patient populations – is not suitable as a recruitment tool for clinical studies as long as the processing of (even anonymised) social media usage data and the training of predictive models by data analytics and artificial intelligence companies is not sufficiently regulated."

Over the past decade, steady progress has been made towards the development of advanced battery diagnostic and prognostic technologies using data-driven methods that can be used to inform EV owners of the condition of their battery over its lifetime. The research has shown promise for accurately predicting battery state of health (SOH), state of safety (SOS), cycle life, the remaining useful life (RUL), and indicators of cells with high risk of failure (i.e., weak cells). These methods yield information about the battery that would be of great interest to EV owners, but at present it is not shared with them. This paper is concerned with the present status of the information available on the battery with a focus on data-driven diagnostic and prognostic approaches, and how the information would be generated in the future for the millions of EVs that will be on the road in the next decade. Finally, future trends and key challenges for the prognostics and health management of the batteries in real-world EV applications are presented from four perspectives (cloud-edge interaction, full-scale diagnosis, artificial intelligence and electronic health reports) are discussed."

By 2017, stage 1 of the RBI has been completed, and research is needed to find out the level of usage, proficiency, and productivity achieved by then. Therefore, a survey was carried out to learn whether the rural residents and their communities are making good use of the new fast broadband connection. The survey collected data from 217 rural residents from North Island, and the results indicate that about half of the interview respondents are satisfied with the new broadband speed and the reliability which is offered by RBI stage 1. However, there is about 28% of the respondents disagreed with them. The majority of the Internet uses for rural residents are information searching, reading news, online entertainment, and online banking. Besides that, only a small proportion of respondents know how to utilize the Internet in their work/business and benefit/profit from it, e.g., using cloud technology capabilities and online marketing campaigns, etc. by then. Therefore, we argue that information and communications technologies (ICT) adoption is not only the availability of the infrastructure but also the beneficial outcomes of Internet availability. In other words, Internet skills in-depth training and education need to catch up with the infrastructure deployment, which is useful to fuel the digital productivity and inclusion for booming rural economies. The survey data-driven findings presented in this paper could serve as a reference to inform government policymakers and those who wish to create, invest, and take actions to speed up the economic and social growth of rural communities in Aotearoa New Zealand through the Internet while shifting from the Internet speed and traffic volume-driven to a more effective Internet connectivity and value-added driven rural economy."

Result shows that whether there is DDM or not, the profit obtained by agency selling is always lower than reselling & agency selling, so FBP and SOP are always excluded as strict disadvantages. When there is no DDM, only when the commission rate and unit sales cost are large, the manufacturer selects reselling. On the contrary, the manufacturer selects reselling & agency selling with relatively low unit sales cost. Contrary to intuition, when the efficiency of DDM is high, low commission rate will induce manufacturer to choose reselling mode, and high commission rate will make manufacturer tend to reselling & agency selling. Finally, we analyze the change in the profit growth rate of manufacturer and platform, as well as the amount of consumer surplus and social welfare through numerical simulation."
85137239741,Green R&D Financing Strategy in Platform Supply Chain with Data-Driven Marketing,Xia Y.,Sustainability Switzerland,2022-08-01,10.3390/su14159172,3,Qingdao University,Article,"© 2022 by the authors.Platform enterprises can improve green R&D efficiency by data-driven marketing (DDM) activities and can also provide financing assistance to manufacturers. In this context, for a platform supply chain consisting of one manufacturer facing a shortage of green R&D funds and a one third-party platform, this paper develops four game models under two financing channels (bank financing channel and platform financing channel) and two selling modes (agency selling mode and reselling mode). The equilibrium results of different models are derived and compared, and then the choices of selling mode and financing channel from the perspectives of both the manufacturer and the platform are analyzed. The conclusions show that the consumers’ sensitivities to green R&D and DDM activities, as well as service commission fee, are major factors influencing green R&D level and both parties’ choice of selling mode and financing channel. In most cases, a platform financing channel can promote the green R&D level better and is more beneficial to the manufacturer and the platform. Only in a few cases, the two parties prefer the reselling mode and bank financing channel. However, agent selling with bank financing will never be their optimal strategy. There exists four situations in which the manufacturer and the platform can agree on a same strategy on selling mode and financing channel."

Therefore, we have modeled a platform supply chain using game theory, in which the manufacturer conducts green research and development (R&D) activities, the third-party platform conducts data-driven marketing (DDM) activities to promote green products, and all consumers have green preferences. The numerical example and empirical analysis methods are used to mine management insights. The government subsidizes the manufacturer’s green R&D, the third-party platform’s DDM, and the consumers’ green consumption. The third-party platform provides an agency selling or reselling strategy to sell products. Our results show that: (1) the sensitivity coefficient of consumers to green R&D and DDM activities has positive impacts on all members’ profits and on the green R&D level of products in the platform supply chain, with three kinds of government subsidy policies. (2) The levels of the three kinds of government subsidies mainly have an impact on all members’ profits and on the green R&D level of products in the platform supply chain with an agency selling or reselling strategy; government subsidies to the manufacturer are more conducive to improving the green R&D level of products. (3) The levels of the three government subsidies and the unit service commissioning fee for selling products are the main factors affecting the preferred selling strategy of each member and the equilibrium of the selling strategy."

Instead, digital vulnerability describes a universal state of defencelessness and susceptibility to (the exploitation of) power imbalances that are the result of the increasing automation of commerce, datafied consumer–seller relations, and the very architecture of digital marketplaces. Digital vulnerability, we argue, is architectural, relational, and data-driven. Based on our concept of digital vulnerability, we demonstrate how and why using digital technology to render consumers vulnerable is the epitome of an unfair digital commercial practice."

As a consequence, 'bad actors' are increasingly exploiting these platforms, which is a key challenge for their administrators, businesses and society in general. The spread of fake news is a classical example of the abuse of social networks by these bad actors. While some have advocated for stricter policies to control the spread of misinformation in social networks, this often happens in detriment of their democratic and organic structure. In this paper, we aim to limit the influence of a target group in a social network via the removal of a few users/links. We formulate the influence limitation problem in a data-driven fashion, by taking into account past propagation traces. More specifically, our algorithms find critical edges to be removed in order to decrease the influence of a target group based on past data. The idea is to control the diffusion processes while minimizing the amount of disturbance in the network structure. Moreover, we consider two types of constraints over edge removals, a budget constraint and also a, more general, set of matroid constraints. These problems lead to interesting challenges in terms of algorithm design. For instance, we are able to show that influence limitation is APX-hard and propose deterministic and probabilistic approximation algorithms for the budgeted and the matroid version of the problem, respectively. Experiments show that the proposed approaches outperform several baselines."

One fundamental problem in causal inference is the treatment effect estimation in observational studies when variables are confounded. Controlling for confounding effects is generally handled by propensity score. But it treats all observed variables as confounders and ignores the adjustment variables, which have no influence on treatment but are predictive of the outcome. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the adjustment variables are effective in reducing the variance of the estimated treatment effect. However, how to automatically separate the confounders and adjustment variables in observational studies is still an open problem, especially in the scenarios of high dimensional variables, which are common in the big data era. In this paper, we first propose a Data-Driven Variable Decomposition (D$^2$2VD) algorithm, which can 1) automatically separate confounders and adjustment variables with a data-driven approach, and 2) simultaneously estimate treatment effect in observational studies with high dimensional variables. Under standard assumptions, we theoretically prove that our D$^2$2VD algorithm can unbiased estimate treatment effect and achieve lower variance than traditional propensity score based methods. Moreover, to address the challenges from high-dimensional variables and nonlinear, we extend our D$^2$2VD to a non-linear version, namely Nonlinear-D$^2$2VD (N-D$^2$2VD) algorithm. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our D$^2$2VD and N-D$^2$2VD algorithms can automatically separate the variables precisely, and estimate treatment effect more accurately and with tighter confidence intervals than the state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrated that the top-ranked features by our algorithm have the best prediction performance on an online advertising dataset."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Expanding green consumption market and precise data promotion advantages make the platform economy have a significant effect on influencing manufacturers to carry out green R&D and production activities, and government subsidies have a positive incentive effect. In this context, for the studies about platform supply chain management with manufacturer’s green production and the platform’s marketing activities simultaneously are rare, we consider that a manufacturer invests in green technologies to produce products and sell them through a smart platform supply chain by an agency selling or reselling strategy, in which the platform provides data-driven marketing technology to promote green products. Four game models are constructed to study the operational efficiency of the platform supply chain considering selling strategy difference and government subsidy. The results show that: (1) The manufacturer’s green technology and the platform’s data-driven marketing levels, as well as all member’s profits are all influenced by the potential market demand of green products, the sensitivities of consumers to green product attributes, and data analysis technology. (2) The service commission rate charged by the platform plays a main role on the manufacturer’s selling strategy choice, when the service commission rate is low, the manufacturer chooses an agency selling strategy and can obtain more profit, but now the green technology level is not necessarily better than that in the reselling system. With the service commission rate increases, a manufacturer that chooses the reselling strategy can obtain more profit, and the green technology level is better than in the agency selling system. (3) Government subsidy can effectively encourage the manufacturer to improve the green technology level, and now the platform will improve the data-driven marketing level. There is a threshold range of the service commission rate charged by the platform in which the government can guide the manufacturer and the platform to reach an equilibrium selling strategy by regulating the subsidy level."

Given an advertisement query and a set of outdoor billboards with different spatial locations and rental prices, our goal is to find a subset of billboards, such that the total targeted influence is maximum under a limited budget constraint. To achieve this goal, we are facing two challenges: (1) it is difficult to estimate targeted advertising influence in physical world; (2) due to NP hardness, many common search techniques fail to provide a satisfied solution with an acceptable time, especially for large-scale problem settings. Taking into account the exposure strength, advertisement matching degree, and advertising repetition effect, we first build a targeted influence model that can characterize that the advertising influence spreads along with users mobility. Subsequently, based on a divide-and-conquer strategy, we develop two effective approaches, i.e., a master-slave-based sequential optimization method, TOAR-MSS, and a cooperative co-evolution-based optimization method, TOAR-CC, to solve our studied problem. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets clearly validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approaches."

All rights reserved.This article reports four parties marketing practices (Coalition avenir Qu bec, Quebec Liberal Party, Parti qu b cois, Qu bec solidaire) for the Quebec general election in 2018. Media coverage of political marketing practices in Quebec leads to believe these parties might have adopted the marketing approach in a greater measure in the wake of the 2018 election through a sustained use of digital data. To test this hypothesis, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the campaign staff of these political parties. Our results indicate that electoral planning is done in the spirit of political marketing. The parties, however, practice partial marketing: they mainly mobilize market intelligence for tactical purposes. Digital technology leads to a refinement of this sales approach. Yet, data-driven campaigning isn t completely taking place in Quebec."

Although data-driven innovation has been proved effective in creating value across many business functions, the pace of adoption of strong data ecosystems seems slower for Arts and Cultural Organizations (ACOs). The paper theoretically explores how data analytics can affect different areas of innovation in the core cultural sectors. By integrating marketing intelligence, arts management and policy literature with illustrative evidence from secondary sources, we discuss the potential impact of data analytics for enhancing ACOs innovation. First, digitalization and connectivity have increased opportunities for customer engagement and empowerment, shifting cultural consumption from a transaction to a relationship with cultural organizations. Second, data-driven metrics allow ACOs and policy makers to match more effectively patterns of consumption and eventually to create value from harvesting and processing information. Finally, although ACOs are encouraged to review their traditional business models through this new trajectory, significant conceptual and organizational barriers question the benefits of data analytics and slow down its adoption. The paper contributes to the academic and policy debate on the role of data-driven innovation in arts management and marketing strategies for cultural organizations."

A big data-driven approach combined with insurance promotions can leverage a wealth of empirical data to develop new customers, motivate existing customers to engage in more activities, and retain existing customers. Insurance business involves a wide variety of scopes and types, and it is labor-intensive and resource-intensive to rely solely on insurance business personnel to process these tedious data. The data-driven approach can find correlations and perform automatic prediction matching according to the characteristics of insurance business data, which saves a lot of time and labor costs. This research uses data mining method and neural network method to mine insurance business data and predict insurance business. This method can accurately capture factors such as the type of insurance business and the amount of the policyholder. The research results show that data mining technology and neural network method have high accuracy and feasibility in predicting insurance business, the prediction error is within 2.38%, and the linear correlation exceeds 0.96. The method used in this study has high accuracy both in terms of new customers and retention of old customers."

However, when handling high-dimensionality housing dataset, traditional statistical-clustering methods have been found to tend to lose low-variance information of the dataset and be deficient in deriving the globally optimal number of submarkets. Accordingly, with the intention of achieving more rigorous high-dimensionality housing market segmentation, a swarm-inspired projection (SIP) algorithm is introduced by this study. Using a high-dimensionality Taipei city’s housing dataset in a case study, a comparison of the proposed SIP algorithm and a statistical-clustering method using the combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering is conducted in evaluating the predictive accuracy of hedonic price models of the housing submarkets. The results show that, as compared to the original single market, the segmented submarkets resulting from SIP algorithm are more homogenous and distinctive, where the resulted hedonic price models have high-level statistical explanation and disparate sets of hedonic prices for different submarkets. In addition, as compared to the use of a statistical-clustering method, SIP algorithm is found to obtain a more optimal number of submarkets, where the resulted hedonic price models are found to achieve greater improvement of statistical explanation and more stable reduction of prediction error. These findings highlight the advantages of our proposed SIP algorithm in high-dimensionality housing market segmentation, and thus it is hoped that the present research will serve as a practical tool to better inform further studies aimed at market-segmentation-related problems."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This study examines the experience of marketing departments to become fully data-driven decision-making organizations. We evaluate an organic approach of departmental sensemaking and an administered approach by which top management increase the influence of analytics skilled employees. Data collection commenced with 15 depth interviews of marketing and analytics professionals in the US and Europe involved in the implementation of big data analytics (BDA) and was followed by a survey data of 298 marketing and analytics middle management professionals at United States based firms. The survey data supports the logic that BDA sensemaking is initiated by top management and is comprised of four primary activities: external knowledge acquisition, improving digitized data quality, big data analytics experimentation and big data analytics information dissemination. Top management drives progress toward data-driven decision-making by facilitating sensemaking and by increasing the influence of BDA skilled employees. This study suggests that while a shift toward enterprise analytics increases the quality of resource available to the marketing department, this approach could stymie the quality of marketing insights gained from BDA. This study presents a model of how to improve the quality of marketing insights and improve data-driven decision-making."

P. Carey School of Business,Article,"© 2021 INFORMSBuilding on the distinction between search and experience goods, as well as vertical and horizontal differentiation, we propose a set of theory-grounded, data-driven measures that allow us to measure not only product type (search vs. experience, horizontal vs. vertical differentiation) but also sources of uncertainty and to what extent consumer reviews help resolve uncertainty. The proposed measures have two advantages over prior methods: (1) unlike prior categorization schemes that classified goods as either search or experience goods, our measure is continuous, allowing us to rank-order the degree of search versus experience and horizontal versus vertical differentiation among products or categories. (2) Our approach is easier to implement than prior methods, because it relies solely on consumer ratings information (as opposed to expert judgment) and can be employed at multiple levels (attributes, products, or product categories). We illustrate empirical applications of our proposed measures using product rating data from Amazon.com. Our data-driven measures reveal the relative importance of fit in driving product utility and the importance of search for determining fit for each product category at Amazon. Our results also show that, while ratings based on verified purchasers are informative of objective product values, the current Amazon review system appears to have limited ability to resolve fit uncertainty. Our method and findings could facilitate further research on product review systems and enable quantitative measurement of product positioning to support marketing strategy for retailers and manufacturers, covering an expanded group of products."

It is the key driver for becoming a market leader. Therefore, it is important that all processes in business are customer centric. Marketers need to harness big data by engaging in data driven-marketing (DDM) to help organizations choose the “right” customers, to “keep” and “grow” them and to sustain “growth” and “profitability”. This research examines DDM adoption practices and how companies can aim to enhance shareholder value by bringing about “customer centricity”. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey conducted in 2016 received 180 responses from junior, middle and senior executives. Of the total responses, 26% were from senior management, 39% from middle management and the remaining 35% from junior management. Industries represented in the survey included retail, BFSI, healthcare and government, automobile, telecommunication, transport and logistics and IT. Other industries represented were aviation, marketing research and consulting, hospitality, advertising and media and human resource. Findings: Success of DDM depends upon how well an organization embraces the practice. The first and foremost indicator of an organization's commitment is the extent of resources invested for DDM. Respondents were divided into four categories; Laggards, Dabblers, Contenders and Leaders based on their “current level of investments” and “willingness to enhance investments” soon. Research limitations/implications: With storming digital age and the development of analytics, the process of decision-making has gained significant importance. Judgment and intuition too are critical to the process. Choosing an appropriate action cannot be done strictly on a rational basis. Practical implications: The results of the study offer interesting implications for managing the growing sea of data. An iterative and incremental approach is the need of the hour, even if it has to start with baby steps, to invest in and reap the fruits of DDM. The intention to use any system is always dependent on two primary belief factors: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use; however, attitudes and social factors are equally important. Originality/value: There is a dearth of knowledge with regards to who is and is not adopting DDM, and how best big data can be harnessed for enhancing effectiveness and efficiency of marketing budget. It is, therefore, imperative to build a knowledge base on DDM practices, challenges and opportunities. Better use of data can help companies enhance shareholder value by bringing about “customer centricity”."

The Smart Tourism Destinations concept arises from the advancement of smart cities. Since information technologies are considered a key competitive element of a city's destination, tourism companies invest extensively in smart system initiatives. Moreover, the smart city concept and related approaches are increasingly recognized by cities worldwide to optimize sustainable environments. Furthermore, a smart tourist city faces the challenge of creating urban areas that residents and tourists can experience together, particularly in cities that pose new tourism challenges. This paper proposes the Data-Driven Sustainable Smart City Framework (DDSSCF) for sustainable green tourism strategies and policies. This paper explores the aspects of technologies essential for creating a smart city and a fashionable tourism destination. The preservation of the climate, protected cultural heritage, and natural resources would contribute to an environment, the economic, social sustainable field of tourism by reducing hazardous pollutants and energy usage. Therefore, based on the preservation limit, it has been classified into three components includes-green architecture, green waste, and green energy as a part of the green management framework at the same time. Hence, green tourism, including marketing efforts, such as green marketing, are necessary for the vision of successful adequate green management activities. The experimental results show that the proposed method enhances efficiency ratio when compared to other existing methods."

The participants’ conceptions of user attributes are recorded both before and after interacting with personas created from real user analytics data. Using statistical analysis to compare the responses, we find that personas had a significant effect on changing preconceptions about the audience segments. After interacting with personas, 81% of the participants changed their preconceptions of the audience, and 94% of the participants maintained or increased the accuracy of their perceptions of the audience after engaging with the personas. Moreover, the confidence of the participants in their responses increased. However, two participants did not change their preconceptions even when faced with contradictory factual information, which highlights the need for accompanying initiatives to align user preconceptions with user data fully."

In these markets, monetary compensation only occurs when there is a user conversion. Thus, a key DSP issue is the design of a data-driven model to predict user conversion. To handle this nontrivial task, we propose a novel Multi-objective Optimization (MO) approach to evolve Decision Trees (DT) using a Grammatical Evolution (GE), under two main variants: a pure GE method (MGEDT) and a GE with Lamarckian Evolution (MGEDTL). Both variants evolve variable-length DTs and perform a simultaneous optimization of the predictive performance and model complexity. To handle big data, the GE methods include a training sampling and parallelism evaluation mechanism. The algorithms were applied to a recent database with around 6 million records from a real-world DSP. Using a realistic Rolling Window (RW) validation, the two GE variants were compared with a standard DT algorithm (CART), a Random Forest and a state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) model. Competitive results were obtained by the GE methods, which present affordable training times and very fast predictive response times."

85096381970,A two-stage model for forecasting consumers’ intention to purchase with e-coupons,Ren X.,Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,2021-03-01,10.1016/j.jretconser.2020.102289,16,Huazhong University of Science and Technology,Article,"© 2020E-coupons (electronic coupons) have been a mainstay of online marketing to attract consumers and promote them to repeat purchase, distributing right e-coupons to right consumers is of critical importance. In big data era, analyzing consumers preferences for e-coupons by their online behavior and the impact of data imbalance caused by low active consumers are rarely studied. Thus, we propose a two-stage hybrid model. Firstly, consumer segmentation is implemented to analyze behavioral characteristics for each segment and distinguish low active consumers, then models are constructed for different consumer segments. The proposed model is applied to a real online consumption data. Consumers are aggregated into four segments: potential e-coupons user, low discount sensitive user, high discount sensitive user (including discount preference and fixed preference). The first one is defined as low active consumer segment and others are high active consumer segments. Isolation forest model and logistic regression model are respectively constructed for them. Result shows that data imbalance is effectively relieved, prediction performance is also significantly better than the traditional approaches. Finally, e-coupons’ usage characteristics for each consumer segment are summarized, according to that, companies can increase sales and improve consumer satisfaction as well."

Collecting and storing information on actual and potential voters, volunteers, and donors has produced extensive databases that are then used to guide microtargeting efforts related to advertising, organizing, and fundraising efforts. But building, maintaining, and analyzing this data are costly in itself. This paper looks at two aspects of data-driven political fundraising: precision and selectiveness, with respect to the alignment of the ideology of potential donors and the ideology of the candidate. Specifically, the proposed model is used to determine the optimal precision in estimating a donor’s location on the political ideology spectrum and the optimal targeting decision for fundraising solicitations given that estimate. Analysis of the model produces guidance for changes in solicitation cost and donation size. The results produced by the model are considered in light of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. The analysis suggests that the Clinton campaign’s larger donation size likely played a greater role than did the campaign’s higher solicitation cost in terms of targeting. The model is also consistent with the Clinton campaign’s higher expenditures on analytics, given their larger donation size and solicitation cost."

Despite its importance, the big data-based strategic orientation in international marketing is yet to be formed conceptually. Thus, the purpose of this study is to systematically review and propose a holistic framework on big data-based strategic orientation for firms in international markets to attain a sustained firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a systematic literature review to synthesize research rigorously. Initially, 2,242 articles were identified from the selective databases, and 45 papers were finally reported as most relevant to propose an integrative conceptual framework. Findings: The findings of the systematic literature review revealed data-evolving, and data-driven strategic orientations are essential for performing international marketing activities that contain three primary orientations such as (1) international digital platform orientation, (2) international market orientation and (3) international innovation and entrepreneurial orientation. Eleven distinct sub-dimensions reflect these three primary orientations. These strategic orientations of international firms may lead to advanced analytics orientation to attain sustained firm performance by generating and capturing value from the marketplace. Research limitations/implications: The study minimizes the literature gap by forming knowledge on big data-based strategic orientation and framing a multidimensional framework for guiding managers in the context of strategic orientation for international business and international marketing activities. The current study was conducted by following only a systematic literature review exclusively in firms' overall big data-based strategic orientation concept in international marketing. Future research may extend the domain by introducing firms' category wise systematic literature review. Originality/value: The study has proposed a holistic conceptual framework for big data-driven strategic orientation in international marketing literature through a systematic review for the first time. It has also illuminated a future research agenda that raises questions for the scholars to develop or extend theory in this area or other related disciplines."

Although many service firms apprehend the return from MkIS, others clearly struggle. It seems that MkIS management capability dynamics and their direct/indirect holistic influence on service firm's competitive performance (SFCP) are unsolved in the current data-driven service economy. This study aims to conceptualize a model and test the antecedents on service firms' competitive performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study utilizes a survey of a sizeable sample of service firms’ managers at the firm level. A total of 250 useable responses were obtained and analyzed through structural equation modeling. Findings: Results reveal that variables under their respective direct influences are positively and significantly related. Interestingly, MkISMC has a relatively large magnitude of positive and direct effects on service firms' competitive performance. The other variables, such as the use of marketing analytics (UMAN), service innovation and management (SINM), partially mediate the effect of MkISMC on the competitive performance of service firms. Practical implications: The findings inform practitioners that MkISMC, UMAN and SINM play a vital role in attaining service firms' competitive performance in the data-rich environment. Overall, it deepens the understanding of the mediation effect of UMAN and SINM of service firms on competitive performance. Originality/value: The study advances theoretical understanding of resource-based view (RBV), market orientation and dynamic capability that formulate the relationship of MkISMC, UMAN and SINM in attaining SFCP in the ever-changing data-driven business economy."

Drawing on the resource-based view, this study argues that a firm's data-driven culture and the competitive pressure it faces in the industry motivate a firm's assimilation of BDAI. As a firm resource, BDAI enables an organization to develop superior mass-customization capability, which in turn positively influences its CRM performance. In addition, this study proposes that a firm's marketing capability can moderate the impact of BDAI assimilation on its mass-customization capability. Using survey data collected from 147 business-to-business companies, this study finds support for most of the hypotheses. The findings of this study uncover compelling insights about the dynamics involved in the process of using BDAI to improve CRM performance."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Digital marketing is a profitable business generating annual revenue over USD 200B and an inter-annual growth over 20%. The definition of efficient marketing investment strategies across different types of channels and campaigns is a key task in digital marketing. Attribution models are an instrument used to assess the return of investment of different channels and campaigns so that they can assist in the decision-making process. A new generation of more powerful data-driven attribution models has irrupted in the market in the last years. Unfortunately, its adoption is slower than expected. One of the main reasons is that the industry lacks a proper understanding of these models and how to configure them. To solve this issue, in this paper, we present an empirical study to better understand the key properties of user-paths and their impact on attribution models. Our analysis is based on a large-scale dataset including more than 95M user-paths from real advertising campaigns of an international hoteling group. The main contribution of the paper is a set of recommendation to build accurate, interpretable and computationally efficient attribution models such as: (i) the use of linear regression, an interpretable machine learning algorithm, to build accurate attribution models; (ii) user-paths including around 12 events are enough to produce accurate models; (iii) the recency of events considered in the user-paths is important for the accuracy of the model."

In the context of e-commerce, it still remains unclear whether online lifestyles are practically influential in predicting consumers’ purchasing preferences across different product categories, especially considering its potential influence over the widely used personality traits. In this study, we provide the first, to the best of our knowledge, quantitative demonstration of online lifestyles in predicting consumers’ online purchasing preferences in e-commerce by using a data-driven approach. We first construct an online lifestyles lexicon including seven distinct dimensions using text mining approaches based on consumers’ language use behaviors. We then incorporate the lexicon in a typical e-commerce recommender system to predict consumers’ purchasing preferences. Experimental results on Amazon Review Dataset show that online lifestyles and all its subdimensions significantly improve preference predicting performance and outperform the widely used Big Five personality traits as a whole. In addition, product types significantly moderate the influence of online lifestyle on consumer preference. The strong empirical evidence indicates that the big e-commerce consumer data facilitates more specialized market psychographic segmentation, which advances data-driven marketing decision-making."

Studies on online purchasing patterns based on user attributes have also been conducted; however, these studies used either only experimental methods (e.g., surveys or ethnographic accounts) or simple user attributes (e.g., age, biological sex, and location) for computational user modeling. This paper, through interviews with professional marketers, identifies their needs to understand multifactorial SNS user (potential customers) attributes—gender (i.e., masculine, feminine, androgynous) and biological sex (i.e., male and female) characteristics—for marketing purposes. Based on 33,752 Instagram posts, we develop a deep learning-based, classification model merged with three modalities—image (i.e., VGG16 feature and gesture), text (i.e., linguistic, tag, sentence, and category), and activity (i.e., reply and day). Our model achieves a better performance in classifying three gender types in the male, female, and male + female cases than the traditional machine learning models. Our study results reveal the applicability of identifying gender characteristics from posts in the marketing field."

The automatic synthesis of advertising images is challenging because the advertising message must be clearly conveyed while complying with the style required for the product, brand, or target audience. In this study, we proposed a data-driven method to capture individual design attributes and the relationships between elements in advertising images with the aim of automatically synthesizing the input of elements into an advertising image according to a specified style. To achieve this multi-format advertisement design, we created a dataset containing 13 280 advertising images with rich annotations that encompassed the outlines and colors of the elements, in addition to the classes and goals of the advertisements. Using our probabilistic models, users guided the style of synthesized advertisements via additional constraints (e.g., context-based keywords). We applied our method to a variety of design tasks, and the results were evaluated in several perceptual studies, which showed that our method improved users’ satisfaction by 7.1% compared to designs generated by nonprofessional students, and that more users preferred the coloring results of our designs to those generated by the color harmony model and Colormind."

In spite of its strategic importance, there is scant attention to investigating customer analytics capabilities in the retail context. Drawing on a systematic literature review and thematic analysis, this study proposes a multidimensional customer analytics capability model by identifying relevant dimensions and sub-dimensions in retail settings. The principal contribution of this study is that the model links a customer analytics perspective to a resource-based view (RBV)-capability of the retailers by proposing six customer analytics capability dimensions and twelve sub-dimensions in the spectrum of market orientation and technology orientation. The customer analytics capability dimensions depict three crucial themes of marketing, such as value creation (offering capability and personalization capability), value delivery (distribution capability and communication capability), and value management (data management capability and data protection capability). By incorporating this capability dimensions, practitioners will likely be able to engage customers and enhance customer equity."

Two Bayesian networks were constructed from samples of city website users (N = 1089) and nonusers (N = 475). Results confirm that the five groups of nodes included in our constructed Bayesian networks were well distinguished as separate constructs and interrelated, centered on two nodes of brand engagement. Results also indicate that two nodes of brand engagement, “sense of belonging” and “participating in activities”, induced positive attitudes and were associated with conspicuous behaviors. Overall, this study demonstrates the dynamic, item-to-item relationships between engagement and behaviors of substantive interest. For managers, it is important in practice to discover the particular variables that play central roles among associated variables."

Jansen et al., published by SciendoPersona is a common human-computer interaction technique for increasing stakeholders’ understanding of audiences, customers, or users. Applied in many domains, such as e-commerce, health, marketing, software development, and system design, personas have remained relatively unchanged for several decades. However, with the increasing popularity of digital user data and data science algorithms, there are new opportunities to progressively shift personas from general representations of user segments to precise interactive tools for decision-making. In this vision, the persona profile functions as an interface to a fully functional analytics system. With this research, we conceptually investigate how data-driven personas can be leveraged as analytics tools for understanding users. We present a conceptual framework consisting of (a) persona benefits, (b) analytics benefits, and (c) decision-making outcomes. We apply this framework for an analysis of digital marketing use cases to demonstrate how data-driven personas can be leveraged in practical situations. We then present a functional overview of an actual data-driven persona system that relies on the concept of data aggregation in which the fundamental question defines the unit of analysis for decision-making. The system provides several functionalities for stakeholders within organizations to address this question."

The automatic color design of advertising images is challenging because it must satisfy esthetic goals while also complying with the color design for different content, brand or targeted audience. This paper proposes a data-driven method to color advertising images automatically according to input product color and context-related keywords. To generate good coloring suggestions, we collected 13,000 well-labeled adverting images and built two probabilistic models to capture stylistic color properties. To collect the color preferences of potential users, we developed a color analyzer to display the result of clustering advertising images. Using the visual display, a user can explore and select images to guide our model to generate more personalized colors. We applied our method to three coloring tasks including keyword-based coloring, product-based coloring and user-guide coloring to test its performance against three coloring goals. In perceptual studies, colorings generated by our method were preferred to those generated by other models or created by non-professional students."

In the marketing campaign, the companies want to target the real user of the GSM (global system for mobile communications), not the line owner. Where sometimes they may not be the same. This work proposes a method that predicts users’ gender and age based on their behavior, services and contract information. We used call detail records (CDRs), customer relationship management (CRM) and billing information as a data source to analyze telecom customer behavior, and applied different types of machine learning algorithms to provide marketing campaigns with more accurate information about customer demographic attributes. This model is built using reliable data set of 18,000 users provided by SyriaTel Telecom Company, for training and testing. The model applied by using big data technology and achieved 85.6% accuracy in terms of user gender prediction and 65.5% of user age prediction. The main contribution of this work is the improvement in the accuracy in terms of user gender prediction and user age prediction based on mobile phone data and end-to-end solution that approaches customer data from multiple aspects in the telecom domain."

However, it is not clear how companies apply data-driven methods to facilitate customer knowledge management when developing innovative new products. Studies have investigated the specific benefits of applying data-driven methods in customer knowledge management, but failed to systematically investigate the specific mechanics of how firms realised these benefits. Accordingly, this study proposes a systematic approach to link customer knowledge with innovative product development in a data-driven environment. To mine customer needs, this study adopts the Apriori algorithm and C5.0 in addition to the association rule and decision tree methodologies for data mining. It provides a systematic and effective method for managers to extract knowledge ‘from’ and ‘about’ customers to identify their preferences, enabling firms to develop the right products and gain competitive advantages. The findings indicate that the knowledge-based approach is effective, and the knowledge extracted is shown as a set of rules that can be used to identify useful patterns for both innovative product development and marketing strategies."

This case describes how the development of a course on data-driven marketing makes use of service design methods. The experiential learning innovation is based on the optimization of customer journey mapping, which encompasses theoretical marketing concepts, modern database architecture and practical digital marketing knowledge. As a visualization of individual interactions with a product, service, or brand, customer journey mapping helps explain the way an interaction occurs in one moment and how it influences all other moments. By taking the “data as a service” perspective on the customer journey, students benefit from a more innovative and creative approach to data-driven marketing, which helps improve their attention and motivation."

Starting from this assumption, the main objective of this theoretical paper is to better understand the relationship between Big Data, AI, and customer journey mapping. For this purpose, the authors revised the extant literature on the impact of Big Data and AI on marketing practices to illustrate how such data analytics tools can increase the marketing performance and reduce the complexity of the pattern of consumer activity. The results of this research offer some interesting ideas for marketing managers. The proposed Big Data and AI framework to explore and manage the customer journey illustrates how the combined use of Big Data and AI analytics tools can offer effective support to decision-making systems and reduce the risk of bad marketing decision. Specifically, the authors suggest ten main areas of application of Big Data and AI technologies concerning the customer journey mapping. Each one supports a specific task, such as (1) customer profiling; (2) promotion strategy; (3) client acquisition; (4) ad targeting; (5) demand forecasting; (6) pricing strategy; (7) purchase history; (8) predictive analytics; (9) monitor consumer sentiments; and (10) customer relationship management (CRM) activities."

The sample was extracted from user generated content (UGC) from Twitter using two methods based on knowledge extraction techniques for business. In Method 1, an algorithm to detect communities in complex networks was applied; this algorithm, in which we applied data visualization techniques for complex networks analysis, used the modularity of nodes to discover topics. In Method 2, a three-phase process was developed for knowledge extraction that included the application of a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model, a sentiment analysis (SA) that works with machine learning, and a data text mining (DTM) analysis technique. Finally, we compared the results of each of the two techniques to see whether or not the results yielded by these two methods regarding the analysis of companies' digital marketing strategies were mutually complementary."

Machine learning (ML) can predict future developments and support decision-making by extracting insights from large amounts of generated data. This functionality greatly impacts and streamlines the strategic decision-making process of organizations. The research gap analysis revealed that a little is known about marketers' attitude toward, and knowledge about, ML tools and their adoption and utilization to support strategic and operational management. The research presented here focuses on the selection and adoption of the ML-driven analytical tools by three distinct groups: marketing agencies, media companies, and advertisers. Qualitative and quantitative research was conducted on a sample of these organizations operating in Slovakia. The findings highlight: 1) the important role of intelligent analytical tools in the creation and deployment of marketing strategies; 2) the lack of knowledge about emerging technologies, such as ML and artificial intelligence (AI); 3) the potential application of the ML tools in marketing, and; 4) the low level of adoption and utilization of the ML-driven analytical tools in marketing management. A framework consisting of enablers and a process map was developed to help organizations identify the opportunities and successfully execute projects that are oriented toward the deployment and adoption of the analytical ML tools in digital marketing."

The existing literature offers a popular framework, called the data-driven method, to delineate submarkets based on principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis; however, the traditional framework does not consider spatial heterogeneity and has difficulty balancing the spatial relationships (i.e., distance and topological relationships) and attribute similarities. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a modified data-driven framework for delineating housing submarkets by integrating geographically weighted principal component analysis (GWPCA), a spatial heterogeneity test, a density-based spatial clustering (DBSC) algorithm, and hedonic validation. The modified framework is applied to housing-market segmentation in Shenzhen, China. The results indicate that the modified framework exhibits the best performance in submarket segmentation in Shenzhen. The framework has important implications and high potential for identifying housing submarkets statistically, and it can be generalized and applied to housing markets in other cities. In addition, the visualisation results can be used by appraisers for property valuation and by city planners for facility management and social-equality improvement and balance."

This new automated fare card/smart card system integrates many parts of a transit fare system, such as physical card, fare product, purchase information, and transit use location. The data are also integrated on a much longer timeframe than the previous generation transit card system. Increased data longevity allows the CTA to embark on a longitudinal study of transit card usage by separating cards in a priori groups. In a period between May 2016 and May 2017, a slight decrease in cards used in the system led to a small ridership drop, but a larger drop in ridership was found in passengers who used the system from one year to the next. This longitudinal application of passenger utilization of the transit network provides the agency with additional information that can be used to adjust fare policies and start marketing campaigns based on customer usages. This allows the agency to improve decision-making ability with greater insight on customer behavior."

In order to solve this problem, a prediction method based on dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the customers’ features are extracted based on experts’ knowledge. So, we get the customer decision table. After that, the maximum certainty of each class union is used as the corresponding variable threshold value to control the decision rule extraction program. Therefore, the extracted decision rules can reflect the data characteristics effectively. In this process, it can learn knowledge automatically without setting the threshold values of consistency level depending on prior domain knowledge or by a complex tail-and-error procedure. Additionally, it strengthens the performance for dealing with inconsistent information systems. The efficiency of this method is illustrated by simulation experiments."

The same scent can be interpreted differently when different names are assigned to it. Thus, choosing the right scent name can increase competitiveness by successfully appealing to desired consumer segments. We propose that such decisions should be data driven (i.e., on the basis of competitors’ offerings and consumers’ preferences) and provide guidelines on how to assign scent names to products in home care and personal care product categories, focusing on capturing market segments. Based on a large web-based dataset of scented products across multiple brands and categories, this article is the first to construct a typology of scent names empirically: unscented, concrete, abstract, and proprietary. After examining firms’ assortments of scented products with different names across 12 categories and comparing them with consumers’ preferences concerning such assortments, we identify major gaps. Overall, consumers demand far more unscented products and products with abstract names than currently offered; however, preferences for products with proprietary names are mostly aligned. Strategic recommendations center on naming scented products to better align supply and demand in the scented product market and capture new market opportunities."

Various underlying challenges for successful segmentation have been studied by the academic community, with one notable exception-consumers' incentives have been typically ignored. This lacuna is troubling, as consumers have much control over the data being collected. Missing or manipulated data could lead to inferior segmentation. The current work proposes a model of prior-free segmentation, inspired by models of facility location and, to the best of our knowledge, provides the first segmentation mechanism that addresses incentive compatibility, efficient market segmentation, and privacy in the absence of a common prior."

Most organisations are interested in finding one or a small number of target segments to focus on. Yet, traditional criteria used to select a segmentation solution assess the global quality of the segmentation solution. This approach comes at the risk of selecting a segmentation solution with good overall quality criteria which, however, does not contain groups of consumers representing particularly attractive target segments. The approach we propose helps managers to identify segmentation solutions containing attractive individual segments (e.g., more profitable), irrespective of the quality of the global segmentation solution. We demonstrate the functioning of the newly proposed criteria using two empirical data sets. The new criteria prove to be able to identify segmentation solutions containing individual attractive segments which are not detected using traditional quality criteria for the overall segmentation solution."
85018826283,Quantitative Analysis for Country Classification in the Construction Industry,Lee K.W.,Journal of Management in Engineering,2017-07-01,10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000522,27,International Contractors Association of Korea,Article,"© 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.The performances of international construction projects are quite vulnerable to the conditions of the host country. Because going overseas requires a substantial amount of resources, the process of country evaluation and selection is important in a firm's decision making. Despite an emerging interest and need for the systematic evaluation of countries, existing studies remain limited to case studies for one or a few countries because of the lack of multiple country databases. To overcome this limitation, this paper performs a quantitative analysis to classify countries in the construction industry. Based on international marketing theory and a literature review, the authors not only identify country classification variables but also suggest an analytical approach for diagnosing multidimensional aspects of countries in terms of country attractiveness and past project performance. To evaluate 32 countries, this study uses international institutional (construction industry-specific and country-specific) data and project-level data for Korean firms over the 25-year period from 1990 to 2014. Using a factor analysis and cluster analysis, this study classifies 32 countries according to four different factors (business environment, market opportunity, the possibility of project success, and market experience) and explains each country's current status. Compared with existing country risk indices, which provide only one deterministic value, the proposed approach has the potential to capture construction industry-specific trends and actual project performance, enabling firms to not only evaluate and classify candidate countries in a timely manner but also to make better decisions when addressing country-related problems in the construction industry."
84953410389,A framework for increasing the value of predictive data-driven models by enriching problem domain characterization with novel features,Moro S.,Neural Computing and Applications,2017-06-01,10.1007/s00521-015-2157-8,17,Universidade do Minho,Article,"© 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.The need to leverage knowledge through data mining has driven enterprises in a demand for more data. However, there is a gap between the availability of data and the application of extracted knowledge for improving decision support. In fact, more data do not necessarily imply better predictive data-driven marketing models, since it is often the case that the problem domain requires a deeper characterization. Aiming at such characterization, we propose a framework drawn on three feature selection strategies, where the goal is to unveil novel features that can effectively increase the value of data by providing a richer characterization of the problem domain. Such strategies involve encompassing context (e.g., social and economic variables), evaluating past history, and disaggregate the main problem into smaller but interesting subproblems. The framework is evaluated through an empirical analysis for a real bank telemarketing application, with the results proving the benefits of such approach, as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased with each stage, improving previous model in terms of predictive performance."

This process creates a ""browsing path"" along which there is potential for repeated interaction between the user and the provider, giving rise to a dynamic optimization problem. A key metric that often underlies this recommendation process is the click-through rate (CTR) of candidate articles. Whereas CTR is a measure of instantaneous click likelihood, we analyze the performance improvement that one may achieve by some lookahead that accounts for the potential future path of users. To that end, by using some data of user path history at major media sites, we introduce and derive a representation of content along two key dimensions: clickability, the likelihood to click to an article when it is recommended; and engageability, the likelihood to click from an article when it hosts a recommendation. We then propose a class of heuristics that leverage both clickability and engageability, and provide theoretical support for favoring such path-focused heuristics over myopic heuristics that focus only on clickability (no lookahead). We conduct a live pilot experiment that measures the performance of a practical proxy of our proposed class, when integrated into the operating system of a worldwide leading provider of content recommendations, allowing us to estimate the aggregate improvement in clicks per visit relative to the CTR-driven current practice. The documented improvement highlights the importance and the practicality of efficiently incorporating the future path of users in real time."

Populations are segmented into meaningful groups that share similar attitudes and preferences. This segmentation provides valuable information about how policy options, such as pricing measures or advertising campaigns, should be designed and promoted in order to successfully target different user groups. In this paper, we aim to bridge between psychological, social marketing and ICT research in the field of transportation. We explore how attitude based segments are reflected in high resolution mobility behaviour data, crowdsourced via mobile phones. We use support vector machines to map eight attitudinal segments, as defined under the European project SEGMENT, to the n dimensional space defined by crowdsourced data. The success rate of the proposed approach is 98.9%. This demonstrates the applicability of the method as a way to automatically map attitudinal segments to a wider population based on observed mobility data instead of using explicit attitudinal surveys. In addition, the proposed approach can facilitate the delivery of personalised target messages to individuals (e.g. via smartphones) or at target locations where users, belonging to specific segment, are located at specific time windows since the data includes the time-space indications."

The paper provides the first systematic analysis of the implications of the virtual world market players Apple, Google, Facebook, eBay/PayPal, and Amazon on traditional retailers' business. We use case study research to identify the elements that are required for and suitable to such a strategy. In a second step, we use design science in order to identify and develop the necessary value creation roles, their activities, and the value flows between them. The paper provides two major outcomes: (1) a set of 12 building blocks for generating and applying customer data for traditional retailers adding mobile services and (2) a role-based reference model for the value network of the future retail customer interface and marketing (CIM). The reference model is validated with expert interviews. As an exemplary application of the model, we show two extreme scenarios with strong and weak retailer market positions. As an additional contribution to practice, we present a further introspective analysis of the value network's key new role - that of mobile customer relationship management service provider - and propose a corresponding functional component architecture that fulfills the information technology requirements for the role's complex functionality. © 2014 M.E.

This has heightened consumers' privacy concerns, leading governments to pass laws designed to protect consumer privacy by restricting the use of data and by restricting online tracking techniques used by websites. We use the responses of 3.3 million survey takers who had been randomly exposed to 9,596 online display (banner) advertising campaigns to explore how privacy regulation in the European Union (EU) has influenced advertising effectiveness. This privacy regulation restricted advertisers' ability to collect data on Web users in order to target ad campaigns. We find that, on average, display advertising became far less effective at changing stated purchase intent after the EU laws were enacted, relative to display advertising in other countries. The loss in effectiveness was more pronounced for websites that had general content (such as news sites), where non-data-driven targeting is particularly hard to do. The loss of effectiveness was also more pronounced for ads with a smaller presence on the webpage and for ads that did not have additional interactive, video, or audio features. © 2011 INFORMS."

As a result of these developments, there is an increasing need for data-based or data-driven methods of model development. This paper describes data-driven classification methods and shows that the automatic development and refinement of decision support models is now possible when the machine is given a large (or sometimes even a small) amount of observations that express instances of a certain task domain. The classifier obtained may be used to build a decision support system, to refine or update an existing system and to understand or improve a decision-making process. The described AI classification methods are compared with statistical classification methods for a marketing application. They can act as a basis for data-driven decision support systems that have two basic components: an automated knowledge module and an advice module or, in different terms, an automated knowledge acquisition/retrieval module and a knowledge processing module. When these modules are integrated or linked, a decision support system can be created which enables an organization to make better-quality decisions, with reduced variance, probably using fewer people. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V."
